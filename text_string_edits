the sum from one to infiintiy of negative one  to the n over n squared < often at the end "n" corrects to ten>
Integral form one to r of e to the x dx <fine>
d dx of one over n minus one <1. the "d dx" must be prounounced concise other wise mangled into random stuff like traffic ticket. 
	2. "n" is translated into 9>
the curl of vector v is zero <if done too quickly 'of' and 'is' won't be heard, otherwise it's fine>
